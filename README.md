This repository contains files for testing the simulation speeds of the following neural simulators:
PyNN (using both NEURON and Brian)
NEURON
Neuron + python (nrnpython)
Brian1
Brian2

More simulators and languages will likely be added over time. Below is a link to a google drive document containing the most up-to-date tables and graphs.
